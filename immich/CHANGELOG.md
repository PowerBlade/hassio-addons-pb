## Highlights

Welcome to release `v1.123.0` of Immich. This is the last release of the year as the team is winding down for the holiday season. Thank you for your support and the fantastic year. We cannot wait to continue adding more features, optimizing, and making Immich a delightful app experience for you and your family.

This release fixes bugs in the web and mobile, notably from the recent new native video player. We also add a feature to allow you to change the timeline view order of an album in the mobile app
