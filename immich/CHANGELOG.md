# v1.125.1

There was a hiccup with the release pipeline for v1.125.0 so we have to change the version

## Highlights

Welcome to release `v1.125.1` of Immich. The release improves how the server queries the database, using a type-safe query builder, Kysely, instead of relying on the magic of TypeORM. Many queries have been given a speed boost to be much faster; some got several times faster. You should see a quicker app experience overall. It has been the work for the last couple of months and a foundation we have been building for many changes in the coming months to the data model of the whole app, which is needed to enable some long-awaited features. Kudos to the entire team for completing it. Alongside that improvement, this release also brings new features, enhancements, and bug fixes. Please see some of the highlights below:

- Node.js security update
- Share-to mechanism on the mobile app
- Enable slideshow everywhere on the web app.
- Fixed a bug where the Android app cannot get newly taken photos from the gallery. However, this fix requires us to roll back another mechanism that allows the app to choose empty albums as targets for backup.
- Fixed a bug where playing particular video codecs would crash the Android mobile app.

## Node.js security update

This release includes a Node.js security update. While we don‚Äôt believe any of these vulnerabilities affect Immich, we still recommend updating soon to avoid any risk.
Share-to Immich

You can now directly share media from other apps to Immich without saving them to the phone‚Äôs local gallery first.

> [!Important]
>
>For uploading photos from the gallery, it is still recommeded to use the built-in backup feature since the share-to mechanism that can cause mismatching upload status. Additionally, iOS defaults to sharing an exported JPEG image instead of the original for formats like HEIC. You can change this by tapping ‚ÄúOptions‚Äù near the top of the iOS sharing menu and selecting ‚ÄúCurrent‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúAutomatic‚Äù.

### Slideshow everywhere

You can now toggle the slideshow mode from all the views on the web app.

### Lens information

This release includes the lens information in the detail panel for our photographer users, making it easier to know which of your favorite lenses was used to capture the photo.
