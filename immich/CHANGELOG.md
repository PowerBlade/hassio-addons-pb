# v1.138.0


> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> For users that are using the **beta timeline**, please update your server to `v1.138.0` so that the sync mechanism can work correctly. `v1.138.0` of the mobile app doesn‚Äôt sync the data correctly if your server is `v1.137.2` or below.

## Highlights

Welcome to the release `v1.138.0` of Immich, this release adds many bugfixes and brings the beta timeline closer to feature parity; thank you all for helping with testing and giving feedback. Please let us know if the release fixes the issues you are facing. Let‚Äôs dive into some of the highlights below

* Reset PIN code with password
* Reset the OAuth ID
* \\[beta\\] swipe to delete album
* \\[beta\\] improvement in the upload and sync process
* \\[beta\\] map view with SQLite


## Reset PIN code with password

In order to reset a forgotten PIN code, the admin user used to have to click the ‚ÄúReset PIN code‚Äù button for the user. Now, users can reset their own PIN code by supplying their current password. 


Note: when password login is disabled, this option is unavailable.

## Reset OAuth ID

Immich stores some configuration in the database to keep track of which OAuth accounts are linked to which Immich users. When migrating to a new authentication system or provider, this configuration becomes invalid and can prevent the user from logging in with the new system. A button and accompanying reminder now exists in the OAuth settings to clear or reset this configuration for all users.
