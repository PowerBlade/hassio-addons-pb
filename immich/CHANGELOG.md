# v1.140.0

## Highlights

Welcome to the release `v1.140.0` of Immich, one more release, and one more day closer to üê¥ Stable-Day üê¥. This release continues the ramp-up effort to bring the beta timeline up to the same feature parity as the old one, while also addressing as many bugs as possible. Thanks to our active contributors, some cool features also made their way into this release. We encourage all Immich users to switch to the beta timeline and use it to help us identify and resolve issues. Let‚Äôs dive into the highlights of this release.

* \[beta\] Background sync
* \[beta\] Read-only mode
* Location management utility

### \[beta\] Background sync

The background sync feature has now been added to the beta timeline. New assets are now detected and pushed to an upload queue, which will be handled automatically by the OS. 

Some tasks, such as local and remote data sync, now also run in the background periodically. So that, as soon as you open the app, the newly taken assets are immediately available on the timeline.

**For those who have been using the beta timeline, please toggle the upload button off then on again to enable the background workers.**

### **\[beta\] Read-only mode**

For parents who have kids who want to look over photos but don‚Äôt want them to accidentally delete or perform any action on them, this feature is for you. By double-tapping on the profile photo in the app, you can only view assets in the main timeline, and all the action buttons will be hidden. Thanks, @Sud-Puth, for proposing and initiating work on this nifty feature!

### Location management utility

Thanks to @Johannbr for putting in time and effort into this feature. You can now find and edit missing location data on a specific date. By going to `Utilities > Manage location` on the web, you will be presented with an interface to select the date to find the assets with missing GPS location and to update them in bulk
