# Highlights

Welcome to release `v1.136.0`. This midsummer release is the culmination of the team's labor of love for the Immich community, featuring the introduction of a new timeline and sync mechanism in beta mode, Android widgets, and one of the last breaking changes we want to make before reaching the stable release milestone. Let‚Äôs dive right into it.

* Beta mode for the new timeline, sync, and upload mechanism
* Android widgets
* iOS widget improvements
* Deep links

## Beta timeline, sync, and upload mechanism

> [!NOTE]
> This is only supported when both the server and the mobile app are updated to `v1.136.0`

This is a series of work that has been happening for months under the hood, from the changes in the database query engine, server‚Äôs queries, and support logic, to integrating a whole new database on the mobile app, and rewriting almost all aspects of the mobile app, you can now try the new timeline with data sync mechanism, and upload rework by go to the `App Settings > Toggle the Beta timeline button`. After toggling, you will be directed to a screen where data migration is executed automatically. You can then proceed to the new experience.

You can distinguish the beta timeline from the old one by the beta symbol next to the Immich logo in the app bar.

### Why?

Over the past year, the major complaints we've received from users have primarily centered around the mobile app. The app simply doesn't feel premium or responsive‚Äîit's often janky and takes too long to become usable when first opened, especially when you have a large number of albums. Users can't even view their local albums unless they've selected them as backup targets. Our technical debt in the data structure has created some truly frustrating behaviors, like forcing users to re-upload everything (only to have it rejected by the server) when they switch phones and end up with a different device ID. Or local photos and videos don‚Äôt show up until they are all hashed, which could take a while.

We've realized we can't honestly call the application stable or confidently recommend it to everyone until we resolve these fundamental problems. We genuinely want this app to be excellent. We want the user experience to be seamless and delightful‚Äîwe want you to feel genuinely happy when you open Immich to browse through your precious memories.

### What‚Äôs new?

#### Data sync
- The data sync is now running in a background thread, separate from the UI thread. This means that during data synchronization, the app will remain smooth to browse.
- The data sync speed should be improved drastically. The data is being streamed to the mobile app instead of being sent there in a single large chunk. This will help users with a massive library.
- The calculation of which data needs to be retrieved from the server is now performed on the server, rather than being calculated by the mobile app previously. This means lower CPU usage on the mobile app and quicker incremental sync.
- The mobile app will now retrieve data from the server and maintain similar database tables within the app. This restructuring enables better offline operation and supports more complex usage behaviors.
   
#### Timeline/Display experience
- The new timeline has been rewritten from the ground up to enhance scrolling and dragging behavior, making it easier for you to navigate the timeline.
- The detail viewer is now more interactive, allowing you to scroll between photos or videos when the bottom detail sheet is opened.
- The album views and other collection views are more lively, featuring a parallax effect to make your album/collection feel alive with *mesmerizing* animation.
- You can now view all albums on the device, regardless of which album you have selected as the target for backing up. You can view them in the \`Library > On this device\` section. For users who want to select individual assets to back up to the server, they can perform that operation from here.
   
#### Upload
- The upload mechanism has been rewritten from the ground up.
- Upload is now handled by the OS, allowing for a better background upload operation. Instead of handling the uploading ourselves, we are now placing the photos and videos in a queue, which will run continuously when the Immich app is opened in the foreground and for a few minutes after it is put into the background. Then the OS will take over and start pulling tasks from the queue, handling the upload process by itself.
- Starting the upload progress is now invoked from a toggle button

</p>

- Uploads are now running **in parallel** . The new upload detail page displays which assets are being uploaded and whether they are experiencing issues or stuck. You can tap on each item to see exactly which asset is causing the problem.

</p>

- On Android, there is no longer a virtual `Recents` album that includes all assets. Instead, there is a button to select all albums for backup.
- In the backup album selection screen, you can now search for the album you want to back up.

#### Expectations of the beta version of the mentioned mechanisms

* The app should be very smooth to browse around during the initial login and subsequent app openings.
* Collections (favorite, archived, locked folder, etc.) and album views should make you feel nice, cozy, and delighted.
* Background queuing of newly taken photos is not yet implemented. We will start working on this next.
* Some views are not yet ported over to the new implementation, such as, but not limited to
  * People view
  * Map view
* Some mechanisms are still missing from the previous implementation, such as, but not limited to
  * Add to album from multi-selection
  * Album sync when uploading
* There are still some buggy behaviors/animations we will be ironing out in the coming days.

### How can you help us?

## Android Widgets

<p align="center">

This is a follow-up to one of our most requested features: Home screen widgets! In `v1.135.0` We introduced Immich widgets on iOS, which included a memory widget and a random widget. With `v1.136.0`, we bring these widgets to Android! Many of the improvements to iOS widgets listed below have also been incorporated into the Android version.

## iOS Widget Improvements

iOS widgets have been improved with feedback from the community:

* iOS widgets now support servers that use insecure HTTP connections
* iOS widgets now support servers that use WebP as their preview thumbnail format
* Tapping on the widget now takes you directly to the image in the app
* Widgets now render properly when used on a tinted home screen
* iOS widgets now cache the latest image for use if network access is unavailable during update. You should see fewer ‚ÄúUnable to connect to your Immich instance‚Äù errors on your home screen!
* You can now choose to show images from your Favorites in the Random Widget
* Improved error descriptions

## Deep Links

You can now deep link into the Immich app. Supported URLs include:

* `immich://asset?id=<asset id>`
* `immich://album?id=<album id>`
* `immich://memory?id=<memory id>`

Some `my.immich.app` URLs will also now open inside the mobile app:

* `https://my.immich.app/photos/<asset id>`
* `https://my.immich.app/albums/<album id>`

Navigating to any of these URLs (via the browser, Apple Shortcuts, NFC, or other automation frameworks) will open the corresponding resource inside the mobile app.
