- Fixed an issue where the bulk location edit triggered an error
- Fixed an issue where the album cannot be loaded in the mobile app if any of the assets in the album are in the trash
- Fixed an issue where searchRandom endpoint doesn't return randomize items
- Fixed some issues regarding the timezone topic
