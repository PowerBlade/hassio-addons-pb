### üîå Network Ports

* **8080/tcp** ‚Üí Immich web interface
* **5432/tcp** ‚Üí PostgreSQL database
* **6379/tcp** ‚Üí Redis database

## üìö Storage Management

### Immich Library

* By default, Immich stores everything inside `/media/immich` (set by `Media Location`)
  
   If you want it to be included in the Addon backup and not in the Media folder, you can change it to `config/library`. Depending on your library size **this will increase the addon backup size by a lot!**

* ‚ö†Ô∏è **Don't** manually move or change files inside this folder, always manage them via Immich UI.
   Immich doesn't scan the media location folder looking for new or changed files, so editing files will lead to errors

### External Libraries

* You can store photos/videos on external folders mounted under:

  * `/media`
  * `/share`

---

## üíæ NAS Storage Setup

To use a NAS for photo/video storage, you must first mount the smb or nfs share in Home Assistant:

1. **Stop Immich**
1. Navigate to **Supervisor** ‚Üí **System** ‚Üí **Storage**.
1. Add a new network storage: ( ‚ö†Ô∏è don't mount the share on your `Media Location` path default: `/media/immich`)
   * **Name**: `immich` (name of the folder to mount share on)
   * **Usage**: `Share` (you can choose `Media` or `Share`)
   * **Protocol**: SMB or NFS (enter login credentials if required).  
1. Update your addon `Media Location` configuration with `/<usage>/<name>` (for the example above `/share/immich`)
1. **Start Immich**
1. **Check logs** and wait for the migration to complete

Check also `Media Library Migration` section to know more ‚§µÔ∏è

---

## üì¶ Media Library Migration

If you want Immich to move your media library to a new folder:

1. **Prepare the New Folder**  
   * Ensure the new folder is either **empty** or **does not exist** (Immich will create it).  

2. **Update Configuration**  
   * Open the **Immich Add-on Configuration Page**.  
   * Change the `Media Location` to the new folder (e.g., `/share/immich`).  

3. **Start Immich**  
   * Immich will automatically perform checks and migrate all media from the old location to the new one.  

‚ùï **Important Notes**:  
* Only subfolders of `/media/` and `/share/` are supported for `Media Location` (or `/config/library` if you want to include your media library in the addon backup)
* Migration may take time depending on your library size
* Once complete, all new uploads will be stored in the new location

## üîí Enabling HTTPS/SSL

HTTPS is enabled **by default** (`ssl: true`).  

1. **Default (Self-Signed Certificate)**  
   * If you don‚Äôt specify `certfile` and `keyfile`, Immich will automatically generate and use a self-signed SSL certificate.  
   * You may see a browser warning the first time you connect‚Äîthis is expected with self-signed certificates.  

2. **Using Trusted Certificates (Recommended)**  
   * If using Home Assistant‚Äôs **Let‚Äôs Encrypt add-on**, certificates will be stored in `/ssl/`.  
   * You should see two files:  
     * `fullchain.pem` (certificate)  
     * `privkey.pem` (private key)  

   Example configuration:  

   ```yaml
   ssl: true
   certfile: fullchain.pem
   keyfile: privkey.pem
   ```

3. **Restart Immich**

4. **Open Web UI**

---

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

* **Uploads Failing**

  * Check storage has enough free space
  * Ensure storage permissions match `PUID`/`PGID`

* **Slow AI Processing**

  * Consider preloading machine learning models (but this may use more RAM)

* **Web UI Not Loading**

  * If using HTTPS, confirm your SSL certificate and key files are valid
  * If using the self-signed default certificate, accept the browser warning
