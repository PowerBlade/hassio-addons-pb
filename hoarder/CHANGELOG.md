# 0.21.0 - The 10k ‚≠ê release!

Welcome to the 0.21.0 release of Hoarder! Hoarder just hit 10k stars on github and I can't be more grateful! We wouldn't have hit this milestone without all of our contributors, users and the awesome community at `/r/selfhosted`! Over the holidays, Hoarder [got featured](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42485746) at the homepage of hackernews for an entire day!

We're celebrating this milestone, with a release that contains some of the long awaited features! This release introduces advanced search capabilities, smart lists, highlighting support, a TypeScript SDK, and more! As usual, we're excited to welcome our new contributors: @lexafaxine, @jdhartley, @medo & @circuitcreature!

If you enjoy using Hoarder, consider supporting the project [here ‚òïÔ∏è](https://buymeacoffee.com/mbassem) or via GitHub [here](https://github.com/sponsors/MohamedBassem).

## New Features üöÄ

- Advanced Search Capabilities: Hoarder's search just got much more powerful. You can now add search "qualifiers" to refine your search results. Qualifiers include: tags, lists, favourite/archived status, creation date, etc. You can read about the new query language [here](https://docs.hoarder.app/next/Guides/search-query-language). Some examples:
  - `is:fav after:2024-01-01 before:2024-12-31`: Find all the bookmarks that are favourited and created in 2024.
  - `(#neovim or #vscode) and -is:archived`: Find all the non-archived bookmarks that are tagged either with #neovim or #vscode.
  - `is:archived -is:inlist`: Find all the bookmarks that are archived but are not sorted in any list.
  - `url:github.com neovim`: Find all the bookmarks that were hoarded from github and contains the `neovim` term in its content.
  - Special shoutout to @kamtschatka who first advocated for the powerful search language and did the first implementation.
- Smart Lists: With the new powerful search, hoarder now allows you to save your searches as what we're calling "smart lists". Smart lists saves you the hassle of manually managing lists, and allows you create an automatic lists that dynamically matches a specific search query. For example:
  - Instead of manually managing a list called 3d Printing, you can now create a smart list with the query `url:makerworld.com or url:printables.com or #3dprinting`. Which will include everything you hoarded from popular 3d printing websites and everything the AI/you tagged with the `3d printing` tag.
  - A smart list with the query `url:reddit.com/r/selfhosted and is:fav` will include all the stuff that you hoarded from the r/selfhosted subreddit and favourited.
- Highlighting Support: You can now highlight your favourite quotes from the links that you hoard, and have a way to view all what you've highlighted. This was one of the most requested features specially for those coming to Hoarder from Omnivore.
- Linkwarden Import: You can now import your bookmarks from Linkwarden thanks to @circuitcreature).
- More translations: Croatian, Danish, Dutch, Galician, Italian, Japanese, Polish, Russian, Spanish & Turkish. Thanks to all those who contributed those translations over weblate (@Jaksa101, @bcanata, @KilFer, @mathyvds and more on weblate).

## UX Improvements ‚ú®

- The admin page now features a sidebar layout, for a more consistent experience with the settings page.
- Bookmarks created over a year ago now show the creation year in the card footer (@jdhartley).
- Added a confirmation dialog before deleting bookmarks to prevent accidental deletions (by @lexafaxine).
- Previously, search used to show only at most 20 bookmarks. This now fixed, and you can scroll across search results.

## For Developers üõ†Ô∏è

- We're now publishing a [minimal typescript sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hoarderapp/sdk) on npm. This allows you to quickly call hoarder's API endpoints with strong typing in both the requests and responses.
- The search endpoint is now exposed in the REST API as `GET /bookmarks/search` with the support for advanced search queries.
- You can now manipulate the assets attached to a bookmark with the new `/bookmarks/assets/...` endpoints.
- The new highlights feature is also available via the API in `/bookmarks/highlights/...` endpoints.

## Fixes üêõ

- Fix missing scrollbar in the preview model for long notes.
- Refactored asset serving to not load the entire asset in memory. This should result in lower memory consumption when serving large assets (e.g. videos and full page archives).
- Added support for self signed certs for android by @CrypticC3s4r (pending mobile app release).
- Previously the iOS app didn't allow connecting to hoarder over http, this limitation should no longer by there (pending mobile app release). Though honestly, you probably shouldn't be serving hoarder over http.
- Mobile devices without cameras (e.g. eink tablets) were not able to install the app. This is now fixed (pending a mobile app release).

## Community Projects üí°

Checkout our community projects page [here](https://docs.hoarder.app/community-projects).

- @Madh93 Implemented [a new telegram bot](https://github.com/Madh93/hoarderbot) that allows you save stuff to hoarder by sending it to the bot on telegram!
