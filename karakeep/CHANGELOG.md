# Managed Karakeep ‚òÅÔ∏è

I have some news to share! With Pocket shutting down, I've been thinking about how to make Karakeep more accessible to a wider audience. So I've decided to start the journey of offering a managed karakeep instance to serve those who can't selfhost.
Karakeep wouldn't be where it is today without its amazing self-hosting community, and that will always remain my first priority. This managed offering is just an experiment. If it works, it could help support the development of the project. **We're now starting a private beta, and you can join the waitlist [here](https://tally.so/r/wo8zzx)!**
