## Enable SSL (optional)

It is **not recommended** to publicly expose OpenSpeedTest and therefore no need for https.

To enable HTTPS simply put your certificate and key file in the `ssl` folder:

- certificate: `/ssl/nginx.crt`
- private key: `/ssl/nginx.key`

**IMPORTANT:** file names and extensions cannot be changed
